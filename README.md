# Object-Detection-With-YoloV4
We used darknet here . Darknet is a open source neural network framework .
Our target object here is glasses object . This includes sunglasses and regular glasses.
First we need to collect images of our target object you can do it from stock photos or using photos from the internet .
Ä°mages of the target object must be in .jpg format .
# Labeling
Now we can start the labeling process. We will do the tagging process on https://www.makesense.ai/ .
You can also use desktop programs like this. This site is useful because that's support output file formats like yolo,json
vog xml,csv,vgg and you can get ouput with file with another formats .
# Training 
After that we can start training our own system. 
You can use open source frameworks to train your system . I will use darknet for this .
In order to use darknet, we can download the files from https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet .
We should use Git Installer to download these files easily . You can get it at https://git-scm.com/downloads .
After downloading them, we have to edit the darknet framework according to ourselves, I will share the edited version of the file with you.
